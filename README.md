Hi there! Welcome to my Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project!  

  

   

 The main concept of this application is to allow users to quickly view upcoming Premier League matches and compare the Win-Lose-Draw odds from all the active Bookmakers in that market space. A statistic section will be introduced to compliment the main section. This section will consist of a Premier League table and team information. 

 This is the core concept behind the application with massive scope to expand and introduce additional features. The second phase of development will involve expanding the statistic section, introducing in-depth historical data. The next phase will include a user login in and ability to select historic statistics to build bespoke match predictions and match them to the best match odds in the marketplace.

The Strategy..  

  

This application is geared towards Premier League sports betting enthusiast that want to build their own bespoke prediction algorithms.  

 

Inspiration and Research  

 

For design inspiration I researched sports betting websites: 

www.betfair.com/‎, www.paddypower.com/‎, https://www.ladbrokes.com/ and www.betway.com/‎ 

Sports websites: 

https://www.skysports.com/football, https://www.fotmob.com/ and https://www.bbc.com/sport 

 Design websites: 

www.awwwards.com, https://blog.hubspot.com/ and www.smashingmagazine.com  

  

I decided to follow a single-page application approach and adopt the main features  
and sections from the websites I researched.

The Scope..  

  

Existing Features 

Landing page – this feature uses css and js to create an interactive UI experience and allows the application to load up current api’s and future databases  

Interactive Navbar and hidden SideBar – these features interact with each other to create a modern and stylish UI experience.  

Main Sections – All of the main sections interact with each other: by toggling opacity and visibility they all consume the same space in the DOM.  

Footer – provides addition links and an interactive comments form that will send the comment to a selected email address 

Features Left to Implement 

Authentication - create user accounts 

Database – allow the application to gather and store future football statics and user predictions 

Expand the main section by introducing additional historical football statistics and interactive user predictions.  

Compare user predictions to best odds in the marketplace.
