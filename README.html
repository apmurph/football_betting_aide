<p>Hi there! Welcome to my Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project!  </p>
<p> The main concept of this application is to allow users to quickly view upcoming Premier League matches and compare the Win-Lose-Draw odds from all the active Bookmakers in that market space. A statistic section is also available to compliment the main section. This section consists of the current Premier League table and team statistics. </p>
<p> This is the core concept behind the application with a scope to expand and introduce additional features. The second phase of development will involve expanding the statistic section, introducing in-depth historical data. The next phase will include a user login in and ability to select historic statistics to build bespoke match predictions and match them to the best match odds in the marketplace.  </p>

<p>The Strategy..  </p>
<p>This application is geared towards Premier League sports betting enthusiast that want to build their own bespoke prediction algorithms.  </p>
<p>Inspiration and Research  </p>
<p>For design inspiration I researched sports betting websites: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.betfair.com/‎">www.betfair.com/‎</a>, <a href="http://www.paddypower.com/‎">www.paddypower.com/‎</a>, <a href="https://www.ladbrokes.com/">https://www.ladbrokes.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.betway.com/‎">www.betway.com/‎</a> </p>
<p>Sports websites: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football">https://www.skysports.com/football</a>, <a href="https://www.fotmob.com/">https://www.fotmob.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport">https://www.bbc.com/sport</a> </p>
<p> Design websites: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.awwwards.com">www.awwwards.com</a>, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/">https://blog.hubspot.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">www.smashingmagazine.com</a>  </p>
<p>I decided to follow a single-page application approach and adopt the main features<br>and sections from the websites I researched.  </p>
<hr>
<p>The Scope..  </p>
<p>Existing Features </p>
<p>Landing page – this feature uses css and js to create an interactive UI experience and allows the application to load up current api’s and future databases  </p>
<p>Interactive Navbar and hidden SideBar – these features interact with each other to create a modern and stylish UI experience.  </p>
<p>Main Sections – All of the main sections interact with each other: by toggling opacity and visibility they all consume the same space in the DOM.  </p>
<p>Footer – provides addition links and an interactive comments form that will send the comment to a selected email address </p>
<p>Features Left to Implement </p>
<p>The statistics section for each team is only hard coded for one team (Bournmouth) and I still need to create a loop for all teams in the league</p>
<p>Mobile Responsive - currently not all features are mobile responsive </p>
<p>Authentication - create user accounts </p>
<p>Database – allow the application to gather and store future football statics and user predictions </p>
<p>Expand the main section by introducing additional historical football statistics and interactive user predictions.  </p>
<p>Compare user predictions to best odds in the marketplace.  </p>
<hr>
<p>Testing.. </p>
<p>A cloned version of this project was created for testing new additions to the application. Once a new section was working correctly in the test area it was introduced into the Milestone-2 application.</p>
<p>All interactive parts of the application were tested manually to make sure no errors occur </p>
<hr>
<p>Development..</p>
<p>This application was developed using the git content tracker control system</p>
<p>Deployment..</p>
<p>This application was deployed to github and published using github Pages at:
